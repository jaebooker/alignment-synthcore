"""Roll idea records up into a results table and per-direction signals.

    python summarize.py            -> results/summary.json, results/SUMMARY.md, results/commons.json

results/commons.json is the hand-off to Alignment Commons: every idea placed on a Commons
topic (idea.json "commons_topic"), what each testbed plants and measures, and direction
signals per Commons topic. The Commons site reads it as site/tests.json.

Direction signal (per Alignment Commons node and testbed):
  mechanism rate = share of tested ideas whose Stage 1 gate passed
  win rate       = share of tested ideas that beat the tuned baseline
Both use a Beta(1,1) prior with an 80% credible interval, so a node with
three ideas cannot look as certain as one with forty. Directions are only
compared within the same testbed.
