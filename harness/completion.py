"""Task completion: which number says the method still did the job, per testbed.

Kept harness-side, not on the testbed classes, so evaluator hashes (and every cached
run) stay valid, and stored records can be re-verdicted from their per-seed results.

A spec names where completion lives in an evaluate() result:
    "capability"            the testbed's capability metric is task completion
    "diagnostics.<name>"    a diagnostic is task completion (e.g. goal_rate)
    "safety"                completion is the safety metric itself; the gate is implied
    None                    the method does not perform a task (detectors, monitors, probes)
margin: largest completion drop (method minus baseline, absolute) still counted as no loss.
floor:  minimum mean completion the method must reach, or None.
