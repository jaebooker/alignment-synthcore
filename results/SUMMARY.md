Verdicts follow rule v2: a safety win also needs task completion preserved (harness/completion.py). Where that changed a stored verdict, the v1 verdict is shown in brackets; see results/completion-verdict-v2/REPORT.md.

Signals leave out ideas whose triage label (results/TRIAGE.md) is `suspected_bug` or `fixed_pending_rerun`: a failure that may be a bug is not evidence about the direction.
